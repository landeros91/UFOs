# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The focus of this project is to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. The table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.
## Results
One can start by going to http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html that will take them to the UFO Sightings site. From there one can speculate if we are alone!
