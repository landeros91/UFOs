# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The focus of this project is to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. The table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.
## Results
One can start by going to http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html that will take them to the UFO Sightings site. From there one can speculate if we are alone!

Some modifications have been made were we can now filter by the following. In the first image, we can reflect the data that is broken down by the filters.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
- One of the drawbacks is that the filtering feature is not as advanced and will not auto populate results or auto fill date. In order to get the correct output, when filtering it must be done according to how the data is structured. Fro example; when typing the date, it must be put in the following format (1/12/2010), not (31/01/2010).
- One recommendation would be to add a drop down with a calendar to simply click the day.
- Second, adding recommended shapes would help the viewer out make out what one has seen or the curiousity of what others have seen.
